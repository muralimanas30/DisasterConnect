## Pagination

All list endpoints support pagination via `page` and `limit` query parameters.

**Example request:**  
`GET /api/incidents?page=2&limit=5`

**Example output:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "incidents": [ /* array of incident objects */ ],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 2,
    "limit": 5,
    "totalPages": 4,
    "totalItems": 20
  }
}
```

**Endpoints supporting pagination:**
- GET `/api/incidents`
- GET `/api/users`
- GET `/api/users/incident-history`
- GET `/api/users/:userId/incident-history`
- GET `/api/incidents/:incidentId/reports` (if you add pagination there)
- GET `/api/incidents/:incidentId/victims` (if you add pagination there)
- GET `/api/incidents/:incidentId/volunteers` (if you add pagination there)

---

## Notes

- All endpoints require JWT authentication except registration/login.
- All responses are JSON.
- Error responses use `{ "error": "..." }` and appropriate HTTP status codes.
- All IDs are MongoDB ObjectIds as strings.
- All incident objects returned have victims and volunteers populated as full user objects.

---

## Usage Summary

- Victims report incidents and add reports.
- Volunteers assign themselves to incidents and accept reports.
- Admins can view, update, and delete incidents.
- All users can view their incident history and assigned incident.
- **Admins (or authorized users) can add additional victims to an incident using `/api/incidents/:incidentId/add-victim`.**
- **When a victim resolves, they are removed from the incident. When all victims are resolved, the incident is marked as resolved.**
